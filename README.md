# library_management_system_in_SQL
In this project i worked with postgreSQL to handle and manage the data in libraries.
This project is divided in three parts, in first part, i would be creating tables and making relationships between those tables,
in second part, i solved Basic SQL questions like selecting a table based on condition, joining the tables
in third part, i solved Advanced SQL questions, like creating procedure, creating own custom table based on customer's instruction, handing CASE based questions, handling dates, etc
