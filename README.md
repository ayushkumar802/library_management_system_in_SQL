# library_management_system_in_SQL
In this project i worked with postgreSQL to handle and manage the data in libraries.
This project is divided in three parts, In First Part, i would be creating tables and making relationships between those tables.
In Second Part, i solved Basic SQL questions like selecting a table based on condition, joining the tables.
In Third Part, i solved Advanced SQL questions, like creating procedure, creating own custom table based on customer's instruction, handing CASE based questions, handling dates, etc
